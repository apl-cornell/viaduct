# Development

We use the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) for builds. You do not have to install Gradle manually; you only need to have [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) available. Gradle manages itself.

Once you have Java installed, just run

```
./gradlew build
```

to build the code.
