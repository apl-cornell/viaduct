# Getting Started

The easiest way to try out Viaduct is by using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). After installing Docker,
run the following in a terminal:

```shell
docker run --rm -it aplcornell/viaduct
```

This will drop you in a Docker container that has the Viaduct compiler installed. To get started, try

```shell
viaduct --help
```

To build Viaduct from source code, refer to the [Developer's Guide](developer-guide/building.md).
